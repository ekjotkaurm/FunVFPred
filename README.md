# FunVFPred: A Random Forest-Based Model for Predicting Fungal Virulence Factors 



FunVFPred fills a critical gap in fungal pathogenicity research by being the first computational approach designed specifically to predict fungal VFs, based on Random Forest classifier. The model's predictive performance was significantly enhanced through the incorporation of UniRep embeddings, either individually or in combination with traditional sequence-based features like AAC and DDE.
