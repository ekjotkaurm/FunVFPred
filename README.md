# FunVFPred: Predicting fungal virulence factors using a unified representation learning model



FunVFPred fills a critical gap in fungal pathogenicity research by being the first computational approach designed specifically to predict fungal VFs, based on Random Forest classifier. The model's predictive performance was significantly enhanced through the incorporation of UniRep embeddings, either individually or in combination with traditional sequence-based features like AAC and DDE.
